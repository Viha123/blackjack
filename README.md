# **Black Jack Game**

### The idea is to clone a webpage similar to this: (hopefully): [blackJack](https://blackjack-kb.netlify.app/#) 
[Repository](https://github.com/bthecs/blackjack-js)


## Personal Goal: 

Main goal is to learn DOM usage of Javascript, and use HTML, CSS and Javascript to make a cool looking webpage. 

## Game (Psuedocode):

- [] Javascript
- [] HTML
- [] CSS

### And then we are DONE

# Ezy!

#AFTER THE PROJECT:
Things that aren't working, but I'm lazy to fix:
  -> Ace needs to change from 1 to 10 depending on situation. 
Things that aren't working, and I don't know how to fix:
  ->for the restart button, I ended up just reloading the page. 
  ->In hindsight that wasn't a good idea because now I can't keep score of the bet and how many times the player/dealer won. 
  ->I don't really know how to improve the restart button part because I already tried many things and it is breaking the game, so I ended up just reloading the game.
